# Chapter 9 - Exercise 8
# Blackjack (twenty-one) is a casino game played with cards. The goal of the
# game to draw cards that total as close to 21 points as possible without going
# over. All face cards count as 10 points, aces count as 1 or 11, and all other
# cards count their numeric value.

# The game is played against a dealer. The player tries to get closer to 21
# (without going over) than the dealer. If the dealer busts (goes over 21) the
# player automatically wins (provided the player had not already busted). The
# dealer must always take cards according to a fixed set of rules. The dealer
# takes cards until he or she achieves a total of at least 17. If the dealer's
# hand contains an ace, it will be counted as 11 when that results in a total
# between 17 and 21 inclusive; otherwise, the ace is counted as 1.

# Write a program that simulates multiple games of blackjack and estimates the
# probability that the dealer will bust. Hints: treat the deck of cards as
# infinite. You do not need to keep track of the cards in the hand, just the
# total so far (treating an ace as 1) and a bool variable hasace that tells
# whether or not the hand contains an ace. A hand containing an ace should have
# 10 points added to the total exactly when doing so would produce a stopping
# total(something between 17 and 21 inclusive).

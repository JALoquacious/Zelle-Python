# Chapter 9 - Exercise 14
# Write a graphical program to trace a random walk (see previous two problems)
# in two dimensions. In this simulation you should allow the step to be taken in
# any direction. You can generate a random direction as an angle off of the x
# axis.
#   angle = random() * 2 * math.pi
#
# The new x and y positions are then given by these formulas:
#   x = x + cos(angle)
#   y = y + sin(angle)
#
# The program should take the number of steps as an input. Start your walker at
# the center of a 100x100 grid and draw a line that traces the walk as it
# progresses.

# Chapter 9 - Exercise 13
# Suppose you are doing a random walk (see previous problem) on the steps of a
# city street. At each "step" you choose to walk one block (at random) either
# forward, backward, left, or right. In n steps, how far do you expect to be
# from the starting point? Write a program to help answer this question.

# Chapter 9 - Exercise 12
# A random walk is a particular kind of probabilistic simulation that models
# certain statistical systems such as the Brownian motion of molecules. You can
# think of a one-dimensional random walk in terms of coin flipping. Suppose you
# are standing on a very long straight sidewalk that extends both in front of
# and behind you. You flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you take a step
# forward; tails means to take a step backwards.

# Suppose you take a random walk of n steps. On average, how many steps away
# from the starting point will you end up? Write a program to help you
# investigate this question.
